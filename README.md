classic tetris with shift hold and space bar drop

This is a modified version of the classic Tetris game based on the guide from https://noobtuts.com/unity/2d-tetris-game/

In this version, specific additions to be created include:
- The ability to press space to quick drop pieces - COMPLETED
- Correction in the rotation of pieces (In tetris, pieces typically rotate around a center, but with the I, S, and Z piece these
  rotations have a center that is not properly indicated in the tutorial)
- Shift holding pieces (not traditional to the game)
- Scoring implementation, and potential networking for multiplayer gameplay

The Goal of this repo is to utilize Unity to create a clean version of Tetris that is commonly played. This is largely as an interest to
seeing how game development works on a simple level, from feature additions to scoring and multiplayer gameplay.
